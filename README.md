# Replicon-eval-SyntaxError-newline-patcher-user-script
use with tampermonkey for chrome, or another greasemonkey script extension

1.	Install TamperMonkey for chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en
2.	Click the blue "Install" button on this page: https://openuserjs.org/scripts/devinrhode2/Replicon_eval_SyntaxError_newline_patcher
3.	Security check: notice none of the colored code has any urls, it's not pulling anything extra in or sending anything out: https://cln.sh/sinIiB
4.	Click the "Install" button (my screenshot shows "Reinstall" since I've already installed it)
5.	Try reloading timesheet site, and it should get past the "Generating Timesheet..." part it would be stuck on before, and you should see this: https://cln.sh/dFuyyU
